On-Demand Resources:



A person can provision resources in cloud whenever needed
without requiring any human interaction with a service provider.



On-demand makes self service with automation possible in a seeming
less way.



Can write the Jenkin job to create a server instance instead
of waiting for architect to create the instance.



Even the cloud provider will have the limitation of
instance. When all the instances available in the particular availability zone
cloud provider also through error to launch an instance.



Ex: in case u shut down the server for some time and restart
it back after some time but in between all the instance of server is occupied and
service provider doesnâ€™t have reserved resources then you might get error to
launch the server back.
